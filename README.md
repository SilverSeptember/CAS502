# CAS502
# Spring 2026
## John Moore, Nicole Silvers
## Description
Course project for CAS 502. A Measles Model will be transferred from Jupyter Notebooks to Python so a GUI and further functionality can be integrated. 
## Challenges
Proficiency using Git and GitHub, which is new to one of us and the other is a non-expert. 
Time zone differences and other time commitments in the form of work, life and courseload will pose other challenges.
Outside events, beyond the control of either participants. 
Unequal coding proficiency and experience will challenge participants. 
## Communications Plan
Asynchronous work in parallel, using slack, canvas and in code comments to notify other of status and challenges.
Honesty and transparency in communications to offset experience and anxiety impacts. 
Mutually understood goal to continue working towards full program functionality regardless of challenge or communication status. 
## Git branching
All team members have committed to a single branch thus far.
For the further development of the project we will use feature branches. We will each develop locally on feature branches for our assigned features. When the feature coding is completed, we will open pull requests (PRs). When each PR is tested and approved, it will be merged with the main branch.
