# CAS502
# Spring 2026
## John Moore, Nicole Silvers
## Description
Course project for CAS 502. A Measles Model will be transfered from Jupyter Notebooks to Python so a GUI and further functionality can be integrated. 
## Challenges
Proficiency using Git and GitHub, which neither of us have previous experience with. 
Time zone differences and other time commitments in the form of work, life and courseload will pose other challenges.
Outside events, beyond the control of either participants. 
Unequal coding proficiecy and experience will challenge participants. 
## Communications Plan
Asynchronous work in parallel, using slack, canvas and in code comments to notify other of status and challenges.
Honesty and transparency in communications to offset experience and anxiety impacts. 
Mutually understood goal to continue working towards full program functionality regardless of challenge or communication status.
